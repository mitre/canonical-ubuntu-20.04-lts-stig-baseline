Use of a group authenticator alone does not\nuniquely identify individual users. Examples of the group authenticator is the UNIX OS\n\\\"root\\\" user account, the Windows \\\"Administrator\\\" account, the \\\"sa\\\" account, or a \\\"helpdesk\\\"\naccount.\n\nFor example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user'\ncapability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when\nneeded, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual\nauthentication prior to using a group authenticator.\n\nUsers (and any processes acting on\nbehalf of users) need to be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than\nthose accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization, which outlines\nspecific user actions that can be performed on the operating system without identification\nor authentication.\n\nRequiring individuals to be authenticated with an individual\nauthenticator prior to using a group authenticator allows for traceability of actions, as\nwell as adding an additional level of protection of the actions that can be taken with group\naccount knowledge. \"\n  desc 'check', \"Verify the Ubuntu operating system prevents direct logins to the root account with the\nfollowing command:\n\n$ sudo passwd -S root\n\nroot L 04/23/2020 0 99999 7 -1\n\nIf the output does\nnot contain \\\"L\\\" in the second field to indicate the account is locked, this is a finding. \"\n  desc 'fix', \"Configure the Ubuntu operating system to prevent direct logins to the root account by\nperforming the following operations:\n\n$ sudo passwd -l root \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium '\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000109-GPOS-00056 '\n  tag gid: 'V-238329 '\n  tag rid: 'SV-238329r654162_rule '\n  tag stig_id: 'UBTU-20-010408 '\n  tag fix_id: 'F-41498r654161_fix '\n  tag cci: ['CCI-000770']\n  tag nist: ['IA-2 (5)']\n\n  describe.one do\n    describe shadow.where(user: 'root') do\n      its('passwords.uniq.first') { should eq '!*' }\n    end\n  end\n  describe command('passwd -S root').stdout.strip do\n    it { should match /^root\\s+L\\s+.*$/ }\n  end\nend\n","source_location":{"line":1,"ref":"./controls/SV-238329.rb"},"waiver_data":{},"results":[{"status":"failed","code_desc":"/etc/shadow with user == \"root\" passwords.uniq.first is expected to eq \"!*\"","run_time":0.000576,"start_time":"2022-12-07T14:54:59-05:00","message":"\nexpected: \"!*\"\n     got: \"*\"\n\n(compared using ==)\n","exception":"RSpec::Core::MultipleExceptionError","resource_class":"FilterTable::Table","resource_params":"[]","resource_id":""},{"status":"passed","code_desc":"root L 10/18/2022 0 99999 7 -1 is expected to match /^root\\s+L\\s+.*$/","run_time":0.000154,"start_time":"2022-12-07T14:54:59-05:00","resource_class":"Object","resource_params":"[]","resource_id":"root L 10/18/2022 0 99999 7 -1"}]},{"id":"SV-238330","title":"The Ubuntu operating system must disable account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles,\nand devices) after 35 days of inactivity.
