  desc "Control of program execution is a mechanism used to prevent execution of unauthorized
programs. Some operating systems may provide a capability that runs counter to the mission or
provides users with functionality that exceeds mission requirements. This includes
functions and services installed at the operating system-level.

Some of the programs,
installed by default, may be harmful or may not be necessary to support essential
organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Removal of executable
programs is not always possible; therefore, establishing a method of preventing program
execution is critical to maintaining a secure system baseline.

Methods for complying with
this requirement include restricting execution of programs in certain environments, while
preventing execution in other environments; or limiting execution of certain program
functionality based on organization-defined criteria (e.g., privileges, subnets,
sandboxed environments, or roles).

 "
  desc 'check', "Verify the operating system prevents program execution in accordance with local policies.


Check that AppArmor is installed and active by running the following command,

$ dpkg -l |
grep apparmor

If the \"apparmor\" package is not installed,Â this is a finding.

$ systemctl
is-active apparmor.service

active

If \"active\" is not returned, this is a finding.

$
systemctl is-enabled apparmor.service

enabled

If \"enabled\" is not returned, this is a
finding. "
  desc 'fix', "Install \"AppArmor\" (if it is not installed) with the following command:

$ sudo apt-get
install apparmor

$ sudo systemctl enable apparmor.service

Start \"apparmor\" with the
following command:

$ sudo systemctl start apparmor.service

Note: AppArmor must have
properly configured profiles for applications and home directories. All configurations
will be based on the actual system setup and organization and normally are on a per role basis.
See the AppArmor documentation for more information on configuring profiles. "
