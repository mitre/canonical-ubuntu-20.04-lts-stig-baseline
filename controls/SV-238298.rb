  title "The Ubuntu operating system must produce audit records and reports containing information
to establish when, where, what type, the source, and the outcome for all DoD-defined
auditable events and actions in near real time. "
  desc "Without establishing the when, where, type, source, and outcome of events that occurred, it
would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an
outage or attack.

Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult
to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
those responsible for one.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this
requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses,
user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames
involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

Reconstruction of harmful
events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough
information.

Successful incident response and auditing relies on timely, accurate
system information and analysis in order to allow the organization to identify and respond to
potential incidents in a proficient manner. If the operating system does not provide the
ability to centrally review the operating system logs, forensic analysis is negatively
impacted.

Associating event types with detected events in the Ubuntu operating system
audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or
capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured operating system.
