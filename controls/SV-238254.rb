  title "The Ubuntu operating system must generate audit records for successful/unsuccessful uses 
of the mount command. "
  desc "Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the 
organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events 
relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. 
 
Audit records can be 
generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy 
filter). "
  desc "check", "Verify the Ubuntu operating system generates audit records upon successful/unsuccessful 
attempts to use the \"mount\" command.

commands: 
 
$ sudo auditctl -l | grep '/usr/bin/mount' 
 
-a always,exit -F

If the 
command does not return lines that match the example or the lines are commented out, this is a 
finding. 
 
Note: The \"-k\" allows for specifying an arbitrary identifier, and the string 
after it does not need to match the example output above. "
