  desc "Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the 
organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events 
relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. 
 
Audit records can be 
generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy 
filter). "

If the command does not return a line,
