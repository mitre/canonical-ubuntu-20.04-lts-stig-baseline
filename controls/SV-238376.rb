then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and 
approvals that are part of a robust change management process. 
 
This requirement applies to 
Ubuntu operating systems with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as 
in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs 
which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be 
allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating 
changes, including upgrades and modifications. "
