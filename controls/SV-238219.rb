  desc "The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server may be
exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding.  A System Administrator may have a
stance in which they want to protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by
unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a ''no'' setting.

X11
forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions
on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11
display through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities
such as keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.

If X11
services are not required for the system's intended function, they should be disabled or
restricted as appropriate to the systemâ€™s needs. "

$ grep -ir
x11forwarding /etc/ssh/sshd_config* | grep -v \"^#\"

If the
\"X11Forwarding\" keyword is set to \"yes\" and is not documented with the Information System
Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement or is missing, this is a finding.
If
conflicting results are returned, this is a finding. "
